 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "Black ICE Mod"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Dark times are coming. In Europe, Adolf Hitler has consolidated his power and his attention is increasingly drawn beyond German borders. Benito Mussolini's Italy continues to embark on daring military adventures. Meanwhile in Asia, the Empire of Japan is poised to attack China. Not even a generation has passed since the end of the Great War and the world has apparently been doused in gasoline again. A single spark may be all it takes."
 HITTING_FAN_NAME:0 "The Hitting of the Fan"
 HITTING_FAN_DESC:0 "Yup, that's right! That umbrella collection is about to come in real handy."
 ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Although the United Kingdom emerged victorious from the Great War, the foundations of its great empire were shaken to the core. A generation of its finest young men were lost on the battlefields of Flanders and Northern France, while unrest spread throughout the Commonwealth and massive debts were accrued.\n\nWith the trauma of the last war still fresh in the memory, it is now facing up to the prospect of another war. It is becoming more apparent that there is unlikely to be 'Peace for Our Time'."
 FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Despite the devastation of the Great War, France is on the road to recovery thanks to its strong economy supported by German war reparations. However, the 'Great Depression' has still affected the country and the new German regime has shown little interest in continuing to pay the war reparations stipulated by the Treaty of Versailles.\n\nWith political unrest at home, the words of Marshal Ferdinand Foch when the treaty was signed 'This is not a peace. It is an armistice for twenty years' appear to be an omen. Those 20 years are rapidly running out."
 GER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A new proud Germany has arisen. Three years have passed since the Weimar Republic was dissolved and replaced by Adolf Hitler's 'Third Reich'. Economic stability has returned after the trying years of the 'Great Depression' and mass unemployment is a thing of the past.\n\nThe military restrictions imposed on Germany by the Versailles Treaty are long forgotten and the Wehrmacht grows stronger by the day. With rumours of German rearmament is more conflict on the horizon?"
 ITA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "On the back of the rise of Fascism, Italy expects a new glorious era. Its forces are currently 'persuading' Ethiopia to be added to the growing Italian colonial empire, but do Benito Mussolini's ambitions stop there?\n\nDominion over the Mediterranean Basin has surely always been her destiny? With a new order of things seemingly taking shape in Europe, when the tidal wave of change arrives, Italy must find a place at its crest or run the risk of being swept away."
 JAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Empire of Japan stands at a crossroads. 'Hokushin-ron', the Northern Expansion Doctrine, is favoured by the Army and calls for an advance into Russia and China. 'Nanshin-ron', the Southern Expansion Doctrine, is supported by the Navy and has the resource rich European colonies in Southeast Asia and the Pacific as its target.\n\n Japan possesses a formidable military, but its industries are in urgent need of resources and time appears to be running out. Which path to choose?"
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "When the dust had settled after the Civil War, the U.S.S.R. had emerged as the undisputed ruler over most of what had once constituted the Russian Empire. Rapid state industrialisation and collectivism followed, often at a great cost in human lives. \n\nNow the Soviet Union is faced with the threat of a resurgent Germany to the west and a belligerent Japan to the east. There are also internal threats within the ranks of the Communist Party to contend with as well..."
 USA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The United States retreated back into isolationism at the end of the Great War and enjoyed a period of economic prosperity during the Roaring Twenties. This came to a dramatic end when the nation was gripped by the 'Great Depression'.\n\nThe American policy of non-intervention in foreign wars has stood firm, but tension is increasing both in Europe and Asia. The 'Great Neutral' may find itself drawn into the maelstorm whether or not it wants to be."
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, both great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance their ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 POL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:1 "Following centuries in which the nation was divided between three empires, Poland now stands proudly independent once again. However its political position is not an easy one. \n\nTo the east, the Soviet Union has not forgotten its humiliating defeat in the Polish-Soviet war. \n\nTo the west, the German Führer Adolf Hitler makes no secret of his desire for more "living space" for his people and that the former German land now under Polish control will be the first step in him achieveing it."
 CAN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Canada entered the Great War as a British colony and left it as a nation. Born in the sacrifices of the Passchendaele mud, Canada now takes its first few uncertain steps onto the world stage. \n\nHobbled by the 'Great Depression' and with internal divisions between Anglophones and Francophones, the future of this relatively new nation looks anything but secure."
 AST_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Australians earned their place in the history books of the Great War with their blood. The sacrifices made in the Gallipoli campaign have not been forgotten - and neither were those who ordered it. \n\nAustralia now stands at a crossroads: should she stay with her colonial master, most likely about to be drawn into more conflict in distant Europe, or should its focus be on the threat that is looming much closer to home?"
 SAF_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "When the Great War began, many in South Africa refused to take up arms for their British masters. The military spent most of the war chasing German forces around their African colonies with limited success. \n\nNow a new war looms on the horizon. Then as now, there are some in that think South Africa shouldn't be fighting against the Germans at all. Some even believe that the time has come for the descendants of the Boers to make their bid for the liberty that was denied to their forefathers."
 NZL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The tiny nation in the South Pacific fought bravely in the Great War, suffering high casualtie rates in the bloody battles at Gallipoli and on the Western Front. Nearly half the men of fighting age had served in the forces fighting overseas and many had not returned.\n\nSome twenty years after end of the Great War, the populace of New Zealand peer anxiously at world events, for this time the threat of war looms ever closer to their own homeland..."
 RAJ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The 'crown jewel' of the British Empire, the Raj of India is a strange mix of imperial power and powerlessness. A small band of elite British civil servant's rule over a vast sub-continent with a populace of hundreds of millions of subjects. From these ranks they recruit the Indian Army, which fought bravely in the Great War.\n\nIndias leaders hoped that the sacrifices she made in the last war would help her gain independence from Britain, but so far, that hope has been dampened. With a new war looming, many Indians believe that the time has come to take freedom - by whatever means are necessary."
 CZE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "During the Great War, Czech troops fought alongside the Entente forces all over Europe in an effort to secure recognition for their nation. Their efforts were successful, and Czechoslovakia rose from the ashes of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. \n\nSince their explosive entry into statehood Czechoslovakia formed the 'Little Entente' alliance with Yugoslavia and Romania with the aim of suppressing Hungary's efforts to restore the Austro-Hungarian Empire, although as resurgent German power grows the political landscape of Europe is rapidly changing."
 HUN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "One half of the late Austro-Hungarian Empire, Hungary was treated as a defeated enemy by the victorious Entente after the Great War losing two thirds of its territory in the Treaty of Trianon. Millions of ethnic Hungarians found themselves living outside its borders, and its economy was left in ruins. Harsh restrictions on rearmament were supposed to ensure that Hungary could never again threaten the peace in Europe. \n\nAs the political climate in Europe shifts, it may be time to finally right the wrongs of the past and regain the former glory of the nation."
 ROM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Romania found herself on the winning side in the Great War and as a result, gained new territories and people - not all of whom were Romanians. To guard against the desires of those countries that were forced to cede land to regain what they felt was rightfully theirs, Romania has created a web of alliances across the Balkans. However, in recent years she has mostly concerned herself with domestic matters and the government of King Carol II has allowed these alliances to lapse. \n\nAs the political situation in Europe changes, Romania may well find herself standing alone - and vulnerable."
 YUG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Yugoslavia came into existence after the merging of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes with the formerly independent Kingdom of Serbia in 1922. Initially Yugoslavia joined both the Little Entente and the Balkan Pact to secure their independence, but recently the assassination of King Alexander, combined with growing pressure internally from nationalists and externally from Italy and Germany has caused drastic upheaval and allowed for a re-evaluation of their political and strategic position."
 MAN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Evicted from the Dragon Throne at the age of six, Puyi, the last Chinese Emperor, has been biding his time. While his former realm tore itself apart in the Chinese Civil War, Puyi found new allies in Japan.\n\nFor Puyi, the establishment of the Empire of Manchukuo in 1932 was but the first step in the quest to reclaim his ancestral birthright. For the moment, he is dependent on the Japanese Army to keep his rule, but in time, an opportunity might arise to cast off the shackles of servitude and become what he was born to be..."
 CHI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Following the revolution that deposed the last of the Qing Emperors, the young Chinese Republic has struggled to survive. Warlords rule much of the land on the periphery. In the heart of the country, the Communists have set up a base area in a remote mountain valley. Just beyond the borders, the Japanese have created a puppet government under the last Chinese Emperor and will try to reunite the country under his rule.\n\nWith many enemies threatening it, the government of Chiang Kai-Shek will have to make hard choices if it wants to survive and rule supreme in China."
 PRC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A mere two years ago, the Communist Party of China faced utter annihilation. To survive, it engaged on the epic journey that would become known as the Long March. With only a fraction of the army surviving the rigors of the march and little industry, the prospects of victory in the Chinese Civil War are slim indeed.\n\nBut in time, the population may be swayed to the Communist cause, new armies be raised, new base areas established, and, when the time is right, the revolutionary struggle will be renewed again, until final victory is achieved."
 WARLORDS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The weakness of the Central Government may yet provide the opportunity for a sufficiently ambitious man to rise to power. At the periphery of the country, local leaders have carved out their own little fiefdoms, caring little for the orders of the Central Government. \n\nWar is on the horizon, and each of these Warlords faces a difficult choice: Collaboration with the Central Government or an alliance with the Communists? Either option promises a chance for a seat at the table, but there is a third possibility - to take China all for themselves."

 TUR_BICE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The youthful Republic of Turkey has finally shaken off its historic Ottoman past. Under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal the old ways are being consigned to history and a newer, more modern Turkey is slowly emerging.\n\nDoes Turkeys geographical position mean that it is well placed to capitalise if war once again breaks out in Europe? Will she be able to defend herself, if attacked, by any of the major factions?"
 FIN_BICE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Finnish Republic looks nervously to the East. Despite a healthy recovery from the 'Great Depression' diplomatic relations with the Russian bear are starting to become strained. Rumours abound that the blood of Finnish civillians is being spilt in the former Finnish Karelian region.\n\nOur tiny nation is no match for the mighty Soviets should conflict come. Perhaps though, we can still give them a bloody nose and maybe find willing allies to help support our cause?"
 SWE_BICE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Sweden is steadily growing its indutrial base to meet demand for its steel, ball bearings and wood products. Can this fruitful Social Democratic nation ride out a potential European conflict?\n\nWould such a conflict perhaps give it an opportunity, along with its Scandanavian neighbours, to align and unite to face its common enemies? "
 HOL_BICE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Holland is still feeling the crippling effects of the 'Great Depression'. With growing unrest within its civillian population will the country be forced to ditch the 'gold standard' which many blame for its current woes?\n\nMeanwhile the Dutch government is heavily relying on its stated neutrality to avoid getting embroilled in European conflict, should it come."
 BEL_BICE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Belgium may be seen by some as an insignificant territory but its posiition as a densly industrialiseed country extracting preciosu resources from its African colony make it a potential target for those with lofty ambitions....\n\n Recovering from the 'Great Depression' with major infrastructure projects underway it still seems that a greater number of voters seek solutions in extremist discourses. Leon Degrelle is gaining popularity and may come to threaten the traditional coalitions of the democratic parties. Flemish nationalists are also active, spreading trouble amongst Flemish soldiers!"
 IRE_BICE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Irish Free State has managed to remain a democracy despite the growth of dictatorships within mainland Europe and the 'Great Depression'.\n\nWith a new world conflict potentially on the horizon should the nation align itself with enemies of the hated United Kingdom or should it attempt to remain neutral and try to secure independence and a united Ireland through diplomatic means?"
 SPR_BICE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The embryonic democracy of the Second Spanish Republic is facing an uncertain future. Opposing political viewpoints means that this nation is currently a melting pot of political intrigue.\n\nWith the potential for a bloody civil war ominously looming within its own borders will it be the nationalists or the republicans who prevail to shape the immediate Spanish future?"
 POR_BICE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Portugese Second Republic, led by António de Oliveira Salazar is a mildly fascist coporative state led by a single party regime.\n\nWith its only neighbour seemingly heading for civil war, how will this country react should another war break out on its borders? "
 BMP_BICE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After the Great War, the area of Palestine came under British administration as a League of Nations mandate with the contradictory purpose of establishing a 'Jewish homeland' and maintaining the rights of the indigenous population.\n\nWhile the rest of the world slowly moves toward war, you, as the High Commissioner, have your own problems to worry about. In the last few years, the mandate has become increasingly agitated as the Jewish population has continued to rise, while the promises for either side have remained unfulfilled."
 JOR_BICE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A former part of the Ottoman Vilayet of Syria, Transjordan became a British Protectorate in 1921 under Emir Abdullah and remained a faithful British ally."
 IRQ_BICE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Born out of three former Ottoman Vilayets, Iraq first came into existence under British administration in 1920 with King Faisal and was granted independence in 1932, but with continued British presence. After Faisal's death in 1933, the country became a pressure cooker, at any moment it would blow up in a civil war. On one side the nationalists and on the other the pro-UK militants. \n\nWill you be able to restore the stability of your country? Or will you bring it to ruin?"
 ##### Blitzkrieg scenario #####
 BLITZKRIEG_NAME:0 "Blitzkrieg"
 BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "In the last few years the world has seen some new wars break out in Europe and Asia. Spain is now governed by nationalists and Japan has fought both the Soviet Union and China for territory, the latter being a more successful battle for Japan. The new non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Germany may be bad news for the rest of Europe."
 ENG_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Although the United Kingdom emerged victorious from the Great War, the foundation of its great empire was shaken to its core. A generation of the country's finest were lost in the trenches of Flanders and Northern France, while unrest spread throughout the Commonwealth and massive debts accrued.\n\nWith the trauma of the last war still in fresh memory, the country now faces the prospect of another. It is becoming increasingly clear that there will be no Peace for Our Time."
 FRA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The Great War still fresh in its memory, France faces a new conflict after Germany showed they have no intention to keep the peace. Strengthening border defenses and choosing Allies wisely may very well be the way for France to avoid a disastrous war.\n\n France was victorious once before, this time shall be no different!"
 GER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After the remilitarization of the Rhineland, the French and the British grew increasingly suspicious of Germany's intentions. The Munich Agreement gave Germany permission to annex the Sudetenland for the sake of its German people. The Molotov-Ribbentrop pact guarantees non-aggression between Germany and the Soviet Union, but also specifies the partitioning of Poland between the two nations. \n\nGermany has waited too long for this moment. The time to act is now!"
 JAP_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "War is raging in the Southeast. Even though Japan suffered some losses early in '39, a big portion of Chinese territory is under Japanese control. Tension is rising in Europe, and while the Soviet Union is focusing their attention on those matters, they shouldn't interfere in the war in Asia. \n\nWhen China's resources are in Japanese hands; the Soviets will be easy to deal with."
 ITA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Mussolini, the dictator of Italy, achieved some fame as a peace keeper for his part in the Munich agreement a year ago. However, German territorial expansion has made Italy see there is more land to claim if an understanding with the Germans could be reached. \n\nAlbania has been conquered merely as a taste of Italy's military capabilities, and the rest of the world would do well to worry."
 SOV_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Supporting Manuel Azaña and the 'Second Spanish Republic' during the Spanish Civil War has clearly shown where the Soviet Union stands in relation to Italy and Germany. Victorious over the Japanese army in several recent border conflicts, the Soviet Union currently seems a power too major for any single country to oppose. \n\nThe promise made by Germany to partition the Baltic States and Poland is welcome at this time."
 USA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The rising tension in Europe is worrying. Although not yet a real concern for the United States, the aggression shown by Germany could soon be heard all over the world. While things are quite peaceful in the west, military preparations may not be a bad idea, all things considered. \n\nShould the United States get drawn into another war, they will be the ones to end it."
 OTHER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."

 CHI_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After two years of war against the Japanese, the armies of Chiang Kai-Shek have bled themselves white trying to stop the assault. The enemy has overrun the richest areas of the country. Little support has been forthcoming from the western democracies, and the Communist seem unwilling to engage the enemy in open battle.\n\nWith the war threatening to spread even further, it appears that the worst is still to come. But as the Japanese attack is slowed by the vastness of the country, they may well turn their gaze in other directions, and new alliances may yet turn the tide..."
 PRC_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Faced with an all-out Japanese attack, the Nationalists and Communists have struck an uneasy truce. Both sides are well aware that this United Front can not last. The Communist base area in Yan'an now forms the front line in the war against the Japanese.\n\nThe Communists must husband their resources carefully if they want to survive. Any casualties suffered in the fight against Japan will be felt twice over when the time comes to fight the war against the Nationalists, and this may well be what the government of Chiang Kai-Shek is counting on..."
 MAN_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Evicted from the Dragon Throne at the age of six, Puyi, the last Chinese Emperor, has been biding his time.

 WARLORDS_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The war with Japan has forced the Chinese Warlords to pick a side. But there can be no doubt that this alliance is living on borrowed time. The day will come when it has outlived its usefullness, and on that day the game is once again open for every man ambitious and ruthless enough to make a play for the title of Ruler of China."
