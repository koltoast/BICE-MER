The Jewish paramilitary organization known as the Irgun claims responsibility for the bombing, but blames the British for the deaths in light of their not responding to the warnings.

In spite of the danger, countless Jewish refugees from Europe are flocking to their new homeland. The future of this young nation is unclear, but no matter what happens, the repercussions will last well into the future."

 mandate.10.t:0 "Arab General Strike"
 mandate.10.d:0 "The Arab community in Palestine is on strike! They are demanding changes in the Mandate’s policies, namely limiting Jewish immigration and limiting the purchase of Arab land by Jews. Those within the government who are calling for a violent crackdown are becoming more and more fervent as the strikes become increasingly violent to both the government and the Jewish population."
 mandate.10.a:0 "We may need help."
 mandate.11.t:0 "The Peel Commission"

 mandate.12.t:0 "The Peel Commission Publishes its Report"
 mandate.12.d:0 "After a year of review, the Peel Commission has concluded. Its report does not bode well. The commission has determined that “An irrepressible conflict has arisen between two national communities within the narrow bounds of one small country. There is no common ground between them. Their national aspirations are incompatible. The Arabs desire to revive the traditions of the Arab Golden Age. The Jews desire to show what they can achieve when restored to the land in which the Jewish nation was born. Neither of the two national ideals permits of combination in the service of a single State.” Strikes and revolts have resumed as both Arab and Jewish militias work to better arm themselves for the coming fight."
 mandate.12.a:0 "This is a disaster!"
 mandate.13.t:0 "The White Paper"

The White Paper also stipulates the creation of a Jewish state within the next 10 years. Due to these new limitations, the Zionist community is outraged. Meanwhile, the Arab leadership, contrary to British expectations, is split on the issue. Amin al-Husayni is the only major supporter from the Arab High Committee of this new policy."
 mandate.13.a:0 "This is our new policy."
 mandate.14.t:0 "Special Night Squads"
 mandate.14.d:0 "As our need for Special Forces grows, so does Orde Wingate’s desire to experiment with new tactics. Orde Wingate trains the government-sponsored Jewish militias, and he has begun to work on Special Night Squad tactics. He has proposed the implementation of these special night teams into our standard armed forces."
 mandate.14.a:0 "Tell him to begin training at once."
 mandate.14.b:0 "He has a thousand silly ideas. Tell him to focus on training more men."
 mandate.15.t:0 "End of the Arab Revolt"

 bmpisrael.2.t:0 "Calls for War"
 bmpisrael.2.d:0 "Western colonial powers have neglected their former Arab subjects. The creation of Israel, a Jewish nation, is not just an insult to the Arabs living in Palestine, but more importantly, a threat. People across our nation are calling for war to liberate our brethren!"
 bmpisrael.2.a:0 "We should check our options."
 bmpisrael.3.t:0 "The Altalena Affair"
 bmpisrael.3.d:0 "Our government has worked hard to turn the many paramilitary organizations into the Israeli Defense Force. While the Irgun has resisted our efforts, until now, they have been fighting alongside the IDF. However, after their doomed efforts to use the Altalena to smuggle in French weapons for their fighters, and the uproar caused by the killing of Irgun members by the IDF in a dispute over these weapons, it is clear we can no longer allow a rogue army to function and make deals with foreign powers from within our borders."
 bmpisrael.3.a:0 "We should send them an ultimatum, “Join us or be destroyed.”"
 bmpisrael.3.b:0 "We cannot allow such a hostile group to join the IDF. We must destroy them now!"
