# BlackIce Submod - Middle East Rework
	Discord Server for this mod: https://discord.gg/8XtdFE8
	This Mod aims to add focus trees to all Middle Eastern countries and aims to function as a BlackIce Submod until it reaches a level of quality that would be enough for it to be hopefuly and eventualy included in the official BlackIce
	You will need all 3 parts of the BlackIce mod in order to play: (Non-BICE version might become available at a later point, non-BICE compatibility not guaranteed)

	Currently using BICE v2.5.4 files except for some .gfx and Commonwealth equipment file localisation that might be from 2.4 but there's barely any point to bother with those at this point
