file written by original maker of the mandatory palestine mod, TragicNumberOne:
#####
5 #s are above a section of code that is added to an existing file by the Mandatory Palestine mod. If the file is completely new, there is no suck marking. In addition, if the new code is in the middle of an existing file, 5 #s will be below end the code.
Note: some changes are not marked at all such as the changes to the Default Israeli Leader and addition of the BMP TAG to this list of nations that do not get a communist/fascist/democratic advisor in zzz_generic.txt .

##########
10 #s are for anything added by the Arab Revolt expansion to the mandatory Palestine Mod. This marking does appear in new files.
